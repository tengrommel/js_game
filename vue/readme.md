# Conditional Rendering
> We want to display text that says if our product is in stock or not,
 based on our data.

## Problem
> Often in a web application, we want elements to appear on the page depending on 
if a condition is met or not.

For instance, if our product is not stock, our page should display the fact 
that it's out of stock.

- v-if
- v-else-if
- v-else
- v-show

# list rendering

## problem
> We want our page to display our product's details. How can we iterate 
through this array to display its data?

# event handling 

## problem

>We want to be able to hover our mouse over a variantâ€™s color and have its variantImage 
show up where our product image currently is.

# class & style binding
> When this boolean is false, we shouldn't allow users to click the "Add to Cart" button. !inStock

# computed properties
> These are properties on the Vue instance that calculate a value rather than store a value

## problem
> We want brand and product to be combined into one string. In other words, we want to display "Vue Mastery Socks" in 
our h1 instead of just "Socks. How can we concatenate two values from our data?"

# components
> In a Vue application, we don't want all of our data, methods, computed properties, etc.
